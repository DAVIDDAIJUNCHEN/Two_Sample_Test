# Two_Sample_Test
This repository has been created to archive experimental data for a two-sample test comparing the performance of ASR models.

## 
There are four ASR models tested on two different types of test sets. The first type consists of regression test sets, which have been collected for general purposes and includes a total of 46 test sets.

The second type pertains to car-related domains, encompassing 23 test sets. ​Among the four ASR models, one is a conventional hybrid ASR model, while the remaining three are End-to-End (End2End) ASR models.

In Tables 1 and 2, we present the Word Error Rates (WERs) for the 46 regression test sets and the 23 car domain test sets, respectively.

​For these tests, by launching 50 parallel jobs for each test set with a Real-Time Factor (RTF) of 0.5, it takes approximately 390 minutes of machine time to complete the regression test sets with one ASR model.​ Similarly, it requires around 35 minutes to finish the car domain test sets with one ASR model.
